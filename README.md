# Bitso
This is a [Tiny World](https://tinyworlds.io/) (<- totally irrelevant tangent) simulation where each cell in the 2d grid represents a location on our world map. This is similar to how battleship's playing field is laid out, in that the user can select a point on the grid and deem it to be an island or apart of the ocean.

### Cool. Where's the ignition?
I use Yarn for package management and orchestration. You can get it [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

```
1. git clone https://github.com/Taiterbase/bitso-take-home.git
2. cd bitso-take-home
3. yarn test
4. yarn install
5. yarn build
6. yarn start
```

### Blast-off!
For this I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) to very quickly deploy my site.
